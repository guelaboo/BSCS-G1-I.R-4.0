Technologies that are driving the IR 4.0

Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0) is being driven by many major technologies, 
which are defined by the integration of advanced technology into 
the manufacturing process to create "smart factories" which are 
more efficient and are capable of flexible production. 
Among the primary technologies underpinning IR 4.0 are:
